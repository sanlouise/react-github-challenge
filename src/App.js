/**
 * Declare your routes here using the `<Route />` component

 * Please make sure to remove it prior to submission.
 *
 * You may see some warnings in the console like:
 *
 *     "You cannot change <Router routes>; it will be ignored"
 *
 * You can just ignore those, it's a side affect of hot reloading
 * with react-router. You may also see warnings logged by React about
 * unknown props. Such as:
 *
 * 		"Warning: Unknown prop `noGutter` on <div> tag"
 *
 * You can also ignore those; this warning was introduced in React 15.2
 * and the UI library used here (material-ui) has not been updated to
 * address these warnings yet. Just make sure that you do not cause any
 * additional instances of these warnings.
